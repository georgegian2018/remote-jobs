I want to know who can assist non Dutch citizens to open their own business as zzp'ers in the Netherlands

Here are key organisations and services that can help non-Dutch citizens who want to open their own business in the Netherlands as a ZZP’er (zelfstandige zonder personeel) — whether you need immigration support, business setup advice, tax help, or practical guidance:

### 🇳🇱 Official Government & Regulatory Support
Before seeking private services, it’s important to understand the official framework:

1. Dutch Chamber of Commerce (KVK)
👉 Government registration for your business
You need to register your business (typically as an eenmanszaak — sole proprietorship) with the Kamer van Koophandel (KVK). This gives you a KVK number which is essential for invoicing and taxation. 

2. Immigration & Residence Permits
If you’re not an EU/EEA/Swiss citizen, you must apply for a residence permit for self-employment or a startup visa through the Immigration & Naturalisation Service (IND). Your business needs to demonstrate economic benefit, and often you need a business plan and proof of clients. 

You can find official guidance on:

- Residence permit self-employed person / startup visa (IND) 
- Rules for foreign self-employed persons working in NL

### 🤝 Organisations & Consultancies That Can Assist You

📌 Other External Resources (English-Friendly)
These aren’t individual businesses you contact locally — but online platforms and services tailored for expat freelancers:

Xolo – A platform that helps freelancers register their Dutch business, handle invoicing, taxes, and administration — especially useful if you want English support. 

Employer of Record (EOR) providers – Some EOR companies can onboard you and handle compliance if setting up a Dutch entity is complex for you. 

###📍 Quick Checklist for Non-Dutch Citizens Who Want to Become ZZP’ers
Check your residence & work rights (EU/EEA/Swiss: usually free to work; non-EU/EEA: need permit). 

Decide on your business form (most ZZP’ers use eenmanszaak). 

Register with KVK – make an appointment at a local office and register. 

Apply for residence permit (if required) – Self-employment visa or startup visa. 

Get your BSN & Dutch tax number (BTW). 

Consider professional help – tax advisors/accountants familiar with expat VAT and income tax.

If you’d like, I can also give you step-by-step action plan tailored to whether you’re an EU citizen vs non-EU citizen, and give you contact links and typical costs. Just let me know your citizenship status!
