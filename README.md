# Support Organizations for Non-Dutch Citizens Starting ZZP Businesses in the Netherlands

The Netherlands offers a robust ecosystem of organizations dedicated to helping non-Dutch citizens establish themselves as self-employed professionals (ZZP'ers). These entities provide targeted training, coaching, and practical guidance tailored to the unique challenges faced by international entrepreneurs navigating Dutch business regulations, language barriers, and cultural differences.

## National Organizations with Migrant-Specific Programs
